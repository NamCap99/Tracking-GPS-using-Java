# GPS Tracking Application

## Overview
This project is a Java-based application for tracking GPS data. It utilizes the Sodium library for Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Swidgets library for the graphical user interface. The application simulates live GPS data from a pool of devices and displays the results in a Java GUI.

## Prerequisites
To run this application, you will need:
- Java Development Kit (JDK), version 11 or later.
- JUnit, for running the tests.
- The Sodium library.
- The Swidgets library.

## Setting Up
1. **Download the Required Libraries**: 
   - Ensure you have `sodium.jar` and `swidgets.jar` downloaded. These can typically be found via [Sodium's GitHub repository](#TODO-Add-link) or the library's official distribution channels.
   - Download JUnit from the [JUnit website](https://junit.org/junit5/).

2. **Place the Libraries**: 
   - Place the downloaded `sodium.jar`, `swidgets.jar`, and JUnit jar files into a folder, e.g., `C:\Users\kxeam\Downloads\Compressed\W09`.

3. **Clone the Repository**: 
   - If the code is hosted on a version control system like GitHub, provide cloning instructions. For example:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/NamCap99/EDC_Assignment3.git
     cd your-repo-name
     ```
